## Model Architecture

- 8 Convolutional layers organized in 4 blocks
- Uses Batch Normalization and Dropout for regularization
- Single Fully Connected layer at the end
- Total parameters: 19,006

### Architecture Details:


## Model Features

1. **Convolutional Blocks**:
   - First Block: Basic convolutions for initial feature extraction
   - Second Block: Introduces BatchNorm and first MaxPool
   - Third Block: Full regularization with Dropout2d
   - Fourth Block: Final feature refinement with 1x1 convolution

2. **Regularization**:
   - BatchNorm in later blocks
   - Strategic Dropout2d placement
   - Dropout before final layer

3. **Receptive Field**:
   - Gradually increases through the network
   - Final RF: 28x28 (covers entire input)

4. **Parameter Efficiency**:
   - Total parameters: 19,006
   - Strategic channel expansion/reduction
   - 1x1 convolutions for channel reduction

## Training Configuration

## Model Validation

The model is automatically tested for:
- Parameter count (<20k)
- Use of Batch Normalization
- Use of Dropout
- Presence of Fully Connected layer
- Accuracy threshold (>99.4%)
- Epoch limit (â‰¤20)

## Usage

To evaluate the saved model:
```python
from mnist_cnn import HyperParameters, load_and_evaluate_model

params = HyperParameters()
model, accuracy = load_and_evaluate_model('best_mnist_model.pth', params)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%')
```

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- torchsummary
- pytest (for testing)

## Testing

Run the automated tests:
```bash
pytest test_mnist_model.py -v
```

## GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration is set up to automatically test:
